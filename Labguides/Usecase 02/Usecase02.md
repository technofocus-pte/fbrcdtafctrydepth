
# Use Case 2: Standalone Dataflow and Deployment Components

## Scenario: Contoso Retail

**Contoso Retail** is a multinational retail and distribution company
specializing in electronics, apparel, and home goods. With a vast
network of stores and a thriving e-commerce platform, Contoso generates
massive volumes of transactional, operational, and promotional data
every day.

Contoso decided to modernize its data platform using Microsoft Fabric’s
Data Factory capabilities. The company aimed to build a unified,
automated, and scalable solution using Dataflow Gen2, Pipelines, and
deployment components.

As part of its data platform modernization initiative, Contoso
identified the need to incorporate external urban mobility data to
enhance its location strategy, customer behavior analysis, and logistics
optimization. To achieve this, the company selected the NYC Taxi
dataset—a rich, publicly available dataset capturing millions of taxi
trips across New York City—as the core dataset for its pilot
implementation.

You, as a Data Engineer at Contoso Retail, were tasked with setting up
the entire flow—from data ingestion and transformation, to monitoring,
parameterization, and automated deployment across multiple environments.
You collaborated with the solution architect to build a data
transformation solution with the following objectives.

- Ingest raw NYC Taxi data and discount files into a Lakehouse

- Transform and merge datasets using Dataflow Gen2 and Power Query

- Automate refreshes and orchestrate workflows using Pipelines and
  Airflow

- Enable dynamic deployments using Variable Libraries

- Integrate GitHub and Azure DevOps for CI/CD and version control

- Promote content across Dev, Test, and Prod using Deployment Pipelines

# Exercise 1: Dataflow Gen2 Using Sample Data

In this exercise, you begin by setting up the foundational data
architecture in Microsoft Fabric. You create a dedicated workspace and
lakehouse, ingest NYC Taxi datasets, and build Dataflow Gen2 to automate
data ingestion and transformation. You apply Power Query steps to clean,
filter, merge, and enrich the data, preparing it for downstream
analytics and reporting.

## Task 1: Create a Fabric workspace

## Task 5: Merging queries

In this task, you join multiple tables (trip data and discounts) to
enrich your dataset. Merging helps consolidate related information into
a single unified view for reporting and analytics.

1.  Select your original data query (In our example, its called Bronze),
    and on the **Home** tab, Select the **Combine** menu and
    choose **Merge queries**, then **Merge queries as new**.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/fbrcdtafctrydepth/refs/heads/Cloud-slice-December2025/Labguides/Usecase%2002/media/image60.png)

2.  From the Merge query window, set the **Right table for
    merge** to **nyc-taxi-green-discounts**. On the top right corner,
    select the **lightbulb** which has detected a possible column match.
    In this example, both tables contain a column titled **VendorID**.
    Select this option to set the columns to be merged on. Click
    on **OK** to proceed. This activity ensures that the data is

# Exercise 3: Implementing CI/CD and ALM Solution Architectures for Dataflow Gen2 in Microsoft Fabric

In this exercise you’ll explore how to leverage variable-references
within Dataflow Gen2 to build more flexible and maintainable pipelines
in the context of CI/CD and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).
Specifically, you’ll learn how to centralize configuration by using
variable libraries, and how dataflows can reference those variables
rather than hard-coded values — enabling smoother deployments across
environments. [Microsoft
Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/dataflow-gen2-variable-references)

You’ll work through a scenario where the source, logic (filters), and
destination of a dataflow are all driven by variables (such as workspace
IDs, lakehouse IDs, filter values) instead of static values.

1.  On the **Data Factory-@lab.LabInstance.Id** dev workspace, select
    the **datafactory_lakehouse** lakehouse.

**Summary**

In this lab, you explored the full lifecycle of building, automating,
and deploying data solutions in Microsoft Fabric using Dataflow Gen2,
pipelines, deployment pipelines, and Git-based CI/CD integration. You
began by creating a Fabric workspace, ingesting sample NYC Taxi data
into a lakehouse, and building a Dataflow Gen2 with transformations,
merges, parameters, and automated refreshes. Next, you advanced to
pipelines, configuring copy jobs, building parameterized templates,
integrating Apache Airflow, scheduling runs, and monitoring execution
results. Variable Libraries were then introduced to dynamically manage
environment-specific values for Dev, Test, and Prod, enhancing pipeline
flexibility and deployment readiness. The lab continued with connecting
Fabric to GitHub, creating repositories and tokens, and synchronizing
workspaces for version control, laying the foundation for CI/CD
workflows. You further extended Git integration by setting up Azure
DevOps projects, linking them to Fabric workspaces, and practicing pull
request–based branching strategies. Finally, you implemented deployment
pipelines to move content across Development, Test, and Production
stages in a controlled, versioned, and auditable process. Through these
exercises, you gained hands-on experience in data ingestion,
transformation, and preparation with Dataflow Gen2, orchestration and
automation with pipelines and Airflow, flexible deployments using
variable libraries, enterprise-grade CI/CD with GitHub and Azure DevOps,
and controlled release management via deployment pipelines.
Collectively, the lab provided a comprehensive understanding of how
Microsoft Fabric supports modern data engineering, automation, and
DevOps practices—from raw ingestion to production deployment**.**
